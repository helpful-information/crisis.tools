<h1>Goal of the Project</h1>
<p>To help our fellow humans with getting accurate and mostly unbiased information in times of crisis. Paid services, and product or service recommendations will not be allowed, partisan news sources will not be allowed, and any source which promotes violence will not be allowed.</p>
<p>The goal here is to spread <em>information</em> that will be helpful. Not political views.</p>

<h3><em>Notes</em></h3>
<p><em>This isn't legal advice, this isn't guaranteed to help, and not everything here is a tool, some things are helpful articles with good information.</em></p>
<p>This project's only goal is to help spread helpful information for those dealing with a crisis, or troubling event. To attempt to be a more central source for helping others deal with really stressful times.</p>
<p>Lastly, this project isn't affiliated with any of these organizations, projects, or websites. I believe (after researching) that these places have valuable information that can help others in times of need.</p>
